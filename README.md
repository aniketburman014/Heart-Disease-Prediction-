# Project Name

## Description

This project is a collaborative effort between Aniket (https://github.com/aniketburman014) and Preeti (https://github.com/preeti2104) to develop a Heart Disease Prediction System. The aim of the project is to create a predictive model that can assess the 
likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various input features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python and pip.
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.

### Installing Gender Recognition by Voice

To install Heart Disease Prediction System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required packages:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run
   ```streamlit run web_app.py```
This will open up a GUI made with Streamlit where you can record your voice or upload audio and the model will predict the gender based on the voice.
